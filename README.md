# Brew Ninja TypeScript/React Developer / Engineer - Take Home Test

This project is for candidates applying to a front-end engineering position at Brew Ninja.  The goal of this test is to assess your knowledge of both TypeScript and React, and give us talking points for the interview (if we proceed to that step).  Please do not spend more than 60-90 minutes on your solution, as we are trying to be respectful of your time.

## Summary

You will be creating a single page application for managing contacts, starting from an existing project. Managing contacts means that a user can list/add/edit/delete contacts.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
1. Code to satisfy the requirements (see below).
1. Notify your point of contact at Brew Ninja that you have completed the task, with a link to your fork.

## Constraints

- Do not add any package to the project, please work with the supplied NPM modules only.
- This project was created using CRA, and we would like to stick to that for running and testing the application.
- Time does not allow for building units tests yielding 100% code coverage; however, you may add unit tests where you feel it helps validate your solution.
- Manipulation of the collection of contacts should only use `contactsCrud` module which is supplied. 

## Requirements

- Default page should display a collection of contacts and the contact's details.
- Details should be: Name, Phone number, Email, Age.
- Contacts should be ordered by Name.
- User should be able to delete a contact.
- User should be able to add a contact.
- User should be able to edit a contact.
- Changes to the collection of contacts should persist.

## Considerations

If you progress to the interview stage you will be asked about your solution and will have a chance to explain your thought process, what you would have done with more time, as well questions about specific decisions.

_Happy coding!_
