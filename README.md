# Brew Ninja TypeScript/React Developer / Engineer - Take Home Test

This project is for candidates applying to a front-end engineering position at Brew Ninja.  The goal of this test is to assess your knowledge of both TypeScript and React, and give us talking points for the interview (if we proceed to that step).  Please do not spend more than 60-90 minutes on your solution, as we are trying to be respectful of your time.

## Instructions

1. Fork this repository.
1. Code to satisfy the requirements (see below).
1. Notify your point of contact at Brew Ninja that you have completed the task, with a link to your fork.

## Requirements.

- Do not add any package to the project, please work with the supplied NPM modules only.
- This project was created using CRA, and we would like to stick to that for running and testing the application.
- Time does not allow for building units tests yielding 100% code coverage; however, you may add unit tests where you feel it helps validate your solution.
